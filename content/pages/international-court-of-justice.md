#### **What is the ICJ ?**

**The International Court of Justice** was created to act as a supreme  
judicial authority within the United Nations. It ensures global justice and safeguards nations’ sovereignty by settling  
legal altercations presented to it by the Member States. It does so by considering previous treaties, international  
conventions and international law.

The ICJ at ILYMUN will help you view conflicts from a new perspective and will offer  
insight on international law and the proceedings of judicial cases. The ICJ is perfect for those interested in  
international relations, law or simply for those who want to try something new.

#### What is This Year’s Case ?

This year’s case centres on the ethnic persecution of the Rohingya people in the Rakhine  
state by the Myanmar Republic. This has resulted in the mass migration of almost 700,000 individuals into the area of  
Cox’s Bazar, in Bangladesh. Consequently, this persecution has caused major problems for Bangladesh, as they have to  
provide refuge for the Rohingya people.  
The two teams of advocates will represent the following groups :  
– Applicant party: Bangladesh  
– Respondent party: Myanmar Republic

#### **How Does the ICJ at ILYMUN Work ?**

The ICJ is composed of

*   2 presidents
*   2 teams of advocates; each team consisting of two advocates
*   12-15 independent judges

Both sides hold opening speeches to present both factual and legal evidence to the judges.  
The judges are given time to question the advocates.

Next, each advocate team presents two to three witnesses. (Witnesses are approved by the  
Presidents of the ICJ prior to the conference.) Advocates are given the opportunity to interview witnesses and then judges  
can also question the witnesses or pose questions to the advocates regarding witnesses.

Then advocates present closing statements. After this, the judges deliberate upon the information  
presented to them and compose a verdict expressing their judgment in the case.

#### **How do Advocates and Judges Prepare for the ICJ ?**

**Advocates** need to research the case and create a report (called a memorandum).  
They also suggest a list of 3-4 witnesses they would like to have at the trial. Finally, they create an evidence packet.

**The Presidents of the ICJ** will work in partnership with the advocates to create  
and polish these documents and then post them on the ILYMUN website for judges to access. To access those documents, [CLICK HERE](https://web.archive.org/web/20181026101439/http://ilymun.org/committees/)

**Judges** should read the documents posted by the Presidents of the ICJ to  
become familiar with the case, the witnesses and the evidence. It is expected that judges will act without bias, be reflective and innovative.

**Presidents of the ICJ** will also guide the judges in their deliberation to help them evaluate  
legal documents and assure the quality of the final verdict.

#### **How do I Sign Up for the ICJ ?**

Delegates who want to apply to the ICJ should be confident in their level of English. Advocates in  
particular should be confident public speakers.

Due to the challenging nature and limited places for this committee we ask delegates to apply for a  
role in the ICJ, by **submitting a letter of motivation** which explains their previous MUN experiences and what makes them qualified  
for the role. Delegates should also state which role they prefer (judge or advocate) and if they are open to taking the alternative  
if they aren’t accepted for their first choice.

Applications must be accompanied by a **letter of recommendation** from the delegates’ MUN Director. Send letters of  
application and recommendations by **<u>FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12</u>** or **any questions** about the ICJ to:
